# sle-bci-demo

## Introduction

In this we are going to build a small .NET application using dev containers with SLE BCI.

## Prereq

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed (only if you are going to clone this repo)

## Create Project Folder

Create a directory call it `sle-bci-demo` or whatever you want really this will be the overall directory we are going to put our app in:

``` bash
mkdir sle-bci-demo
```

Now we are going to change our current directory to the one we just created:

``` bash
cd sle-bci-demo
```

Open this directory with `VS Code`.

## Dev Container File

Within `VS Code` we need to create a directory called `.devcontainer` and within that directory a file called `devcontainer.json`.

In this file we need to add the base brackets for json:

``` json
{
    
}
```
